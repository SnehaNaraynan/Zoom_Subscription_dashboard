## __Summary of Insights__

__Plan Type__
• Enterprise plans experienced a sharp spike in early 2020, peaking at $234K in weekly bookings. However, they show recurring summer dips across both 2020 and 2021 — likely linked to seasonal or external factors.
• Business plans steadily dominated overall sales, maintaining high booking volume through 2021, but show a gradual decline in the final quarter of 2021.
• Pro plans remained the most stable, but with significantly lower weekly revenue (~$90K) compared to other tiers. Their ARPU remains the lowest at around $76, indicating lower monetization.

__Plan Period__
• Yearly subscriptions make up more than 90% of total sales consistently across the timeline.
• While monthly plans contribute marginally to revenue, they appear to provide stability when yearly plan performance dips, particularly in late 2021.
• A $411K weekly revenue spike for yearly plans in mid-2020 aligns with early pandemic adoption surges.

__Region__
• North America contributes over 50% of total revenue, especially during pandemic peaks — dominating all other regions.
• EMEA shows relatively stable contribution, but with visible fluctuations mid-2021, suggesting potential volatility or inconsistent campaigns.
• APAC and LATAM contribute smaller shares but show slow upward momentum, particularly APAC in Q4 2021.

__Recommendations & Next Steps__
• Investigate Enterprise plan summer dips: Explore whether drops are seasonality or related to product fatigue. Consider retention campaigns or mid-year feature releases.
• Address Business plan drop-off: Analyze customer churn or competitor gains in Q4 2021. Test potential pricing or positioning changes.
• Reinforce yearly plan stickiness: Explore trial-to-yearly conversion nudges, and add loyalty incentives around renewal cycles.
• Stabilize EMEA performance: Consider region-specific marketing strategies or promotions during volatile quarters.
